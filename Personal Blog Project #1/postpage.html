                            Eight years of gathering with your friends on Discord and spending time together. Youâ€™ve been getting a few rounds 
                            of your favorite game in, discussing which fan-ship from that anime youâ€™re obsessed with is best, or staying up late 
                            into the night in Voice with your best friends. At this rate, weâ€™ll qualify for a senior discount at the local deliâ€¦ 
                            mmm, corned beefâ€¦

                        <p>Just made some new friends and donâ€™t share a mutual server with them to enjoy Activities in? Now, you can launch and enjoy 
                            Activities while in a voice call in DMs and Group DMs using the rocketship (ðŸš€) button while in a call, just like you can 
                            in a serverâ€™s Voice channel. If youâ€™ve found yourself in a debate that can only be solved with a good olâ€™ Chess duel, hop 
                            on a private call with your friend in a DM and play there instead of on a server.Never played an Activity before and wanna 
                            see whatâ€™s possible? Head on over to either our Activities blog post to see whatâ€™s available or the support article for

                        <p>Your friends are together in Voice, playing Sketch Heads, blaring some party airhorns using Soundboard, and using Reactions 
                            in Voice to cover your screen in ðŸŽ‰ emojis â€¦ the only thing thatâ€™s missing is your trusty Personal Party Equipment 
                            (PPE for short).During our birthday celebration, Nitro members can join the party in style with a new set of Avatar 
                            Decorations. Head to User Settings > Profiles on either desktop or mobile and choose from a selection of snazzy new 
                            decorations, such as headphones, space-ready helmets, and a HUD interface to make yourself look like youâ€™re piloting a mech.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Birthday parties arenâ€™t complete without gifting something to the friends you care about. Thatâ€™s why, Nitro members can share 
                            a special two-week trial of Discord Nitro with up to three of their soon-to-be-lucky friends! 
                            If one of your friends is eligible for a Nitro trial, youâ€™ll see a new Nitro-shaped button when you go to talk to them in DMs. 
                            Select that, and you can offer them one of your three free trials. Theyâ€™ll be able to use the special birthday avatar decorations 
                            and try out our newest features like Super Reactions, Color Themes, and more. 
                            Both of these Nitro perks are around for a full month, and will end on June 15</p>
